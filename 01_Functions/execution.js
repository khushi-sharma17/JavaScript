// JavaScript Execution Context  = how js runs a code 

// JS is a single threaded 
/* 
- Global Execution Context = which is reffered by "this" , and is different in browsers 
- Function EC
- Eval EC = which is a property of global , so not necessary 


- Memory Creation Phase = memory is allocated 
- Execution Phase
